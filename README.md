# Description
- Neo Version: 0.0.5

Neo is a template bot for users wanting a stable bot they can work on and host quickly without relying on others.

This isn't a full fledged bot with a frontend or anything like that. It's a template bot only, so you will have to create everything else yourself.

The objective of this bot is to keep the code as dynamic and modular as possible whilst minimising reliability between
"modules".

These "modules" are just like anything else, you can edit the states of various things such as enabling/disabling commands or databases
for example.

It's far off any type of standard yet, and a work in progress nonetheless, it's getting there.

Inspiration for this stemmed from the following project: [Sandplate](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate) by [006000208](https://github.com/06000208) - done in JavaScript and a great project. So, I thought why not do one in Python?

I've also worked on [an open source discord bot project](https://github.com/pritam42069/yadps-chan) for a while as it's a fork from here, so I brought some of my optimisations over. Check it out, it's a cool bot.

This project is a hobby project, so there will be inconsistencies.

# Roadmap
 * [x] Create basic dynamic logging system
 * [x] Create bot configuration system
 * [x] Create modular command system
 * [x] Create docker build images and docker-compose for launching the bot
 * [x] Create project setup ready for contributions
 * [ ] Realtime interface directly with the bot server sided for elevated backend interaction (crying atm)
 * [x] More to be added

# Key features
