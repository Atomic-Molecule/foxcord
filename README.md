# Description
- neo Version: 0.0.5

neo aims to be beginner-friendly, but will also fall in the category for experienced users. 

The objective of this bot is to keep the code as dynamic and modular as possible whilst minimising reliability between
"modules".

It's quite far off that standard yet, and a work in progress but it's really getting there.

Inspiration for this stemmed from the following project: [Sandplate](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate) by [006000208](https://github.com/06000208) - done in JavaScript and a great project. So, I thought why not do one in Python?

I've also worked on [an open source discord bot project](https://github.com/pritam42069/yadps-chan) for a while as it's a fork from here, so I brought some of my optimisations over. Check it out, it's a cool bot.


This project isn't maintained consistently, it's a hobby project to work on over time.
# Roadmap
 * [x] Create basic dynamic logging system
 * [x] Create bot configuration system
 * [x] Create modular command system
 * [x] Create docker build images and docker-compose for launching the bot
 * [x] Create project setup ready for contributions
 * [ ] Realtime interface directly with the bot server sided for elevated backend interaction (crying atm)
 * [x] More to be added

# Key features
