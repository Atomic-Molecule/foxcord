# Description
- Neo Version: 0.0.5

Neo is a templated Discord bot written in python.

The main objective I had with this bot was to make it user friendly and modular, i.e. interchangeable components without messing with core function.

# Roadmap
 * [x] Logging system
 * [x] Parsable configurations
 * [x] Modular command system with a built-in dynamic loader
 * [x] Docker support

# Setup

The setup of the project is currently being reworked.
