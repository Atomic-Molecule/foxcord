# Requirements
- Python: 3.10
- Discordpy: >=1.7.3 


# Description
- Foxcord Version: 0.1.1

A template bot for discordpy with a completely isolated approach source side, as well configurations for the host the bot will run on i.e Linux/Windows. 

Foxcord aims to be beginner-friendly whilst targeting experienced users. Providing a "straight out of the box" solution with a modular and dynamic code base.

Inspiration for this stemmed from the following project: [Sandplate](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate) by [006000208](https://github.com/06000208) - done in JavaScript and a great project. So, I thought why not do one in Python?

# Roadmap
 * [x] Create basic dynamic logging system
 * [x] Create bot configuration system
 * [x] Create modular command system 
 * [ ] Create project setup scripts for linux, macos, windows.
 * [ ] Create docker build images and docker-compose for launching the bot
 * [ ] Create setup for bot configuration
 * [x] Create project setup ready for contributions
 * [ ] Realtime interface directly with the bot server sided for elevated backend interaction
 * [x] More to be added

# Key features
- As stated in the description, a very modular system to use and design with
- Support for all operating systems (MacOS, Linux, Windows) including Linux distributions
  - Further support for Linux means the bot can be set up as a systemd service, the same goes for Windows with it's services
- Beginner-friendly
- Useful base features
- Built-in bot debugging tools
