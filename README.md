# Description
A template bot for discordpy with a completely isolated approach source side, as well as the system the bot will host from. 

Foxcord aims to be a beginner-friendly and target experienced users. Providing a "straight out the box" setup whilst retaining modularity with good, clean code.

Inspiration for this project is from the following project: [Sandplate](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate) by [006000208](https://github.com/06000208) - done in JavaScript and a great project. So, I thought why not do one in Python?

# Roadmap
 * [ ] Create dynamic logging system
 * [ ] Create bot configuration system
 * [ ] Create modular command system 
 * [ ] Create project setup scripts for linux, macos, windows.
 * [ ] Create docker build images and docker-compose for launching the bot
 * [ ] Realtime interface directly with the bot server sided for elevated interaction
 * [x] More to be added
