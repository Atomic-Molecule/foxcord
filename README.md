# Requirements
Check [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Atomic-Molecule/foxcord/blob/main-(stable)/requirements.txt)


# Description
- Foxcord Version: 0.0.4

Foxcord aims to be beginner-friendly, but will also fall in the category for experienced users. 

The objective of this bot is to keep the code as dynamic and modular as possible whilst minimising reliability between code.

Inspiration for this stemmed from the following project: [Sandplate](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate) by [006000208](https://github.com/06000208) - done in JavaScript and a great project. So, I thought why not do one in Python?

# Roadmap

 * [x] Create project setup ready for contributions
 * [ ] Realtime interface directly with the bot server sided for elevated backend interaction
 * [x] More to be added
