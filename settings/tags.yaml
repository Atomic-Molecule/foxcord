      "Use codeblocks for readability while sending code.\n\n
      For example\n
      \\`\\`\\`c\n
      int main() {\n
      \t//some code here\n
      }\n
      \\`\\`\\`\n
      becomes\n
      ```c\n
      int main() {\n
      //some code here\n
      }\n
      ```\n
      Note that these are backticks, not quotes."

      "Sometimes the code is too big to fit into a discord codeblock, rather than uploading it as a text file, paste it on https://pastebin.com/
      \n\n
      After pasting the code, be sure to save it with `ctrl+s`, copy the URL and post it in the related channel."
